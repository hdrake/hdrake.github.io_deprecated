				<h3>About me</h3>
				<p> I am currently a NOAA Climate & Global Change postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University and NOAA's
					Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. I received my Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography and Climate
					Physics from the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in 2021. My doctoral dissertation demonstrates that the
					global ocean overturning circulation is controlled by the small-scale turbulence and seafloor
					topography in the bottom boundary layer of the ocean, none of which is presently resolves or
					parameterized in global climate models. Thus, my postdoctoral work aims to develop parameterizations
					for these processes to ultimately determine their role in the Earth System.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am generally interested in atmosphere-ocean climate dynamics, especially on long timescales, as
					well as the history and philosophy of climate modelling. I am passionate about making
					scientific institutions more diverse and inclusive, so that all scientists feel welcome, supported,
					and valued. I also enjoy developing open-source software, such as my new package <a
						href="https://github.com/hdrake/ClimateMARGO.jl">ClimateMARGO.jl</a>, which is an extremely
					simple climate-economic model for quantitively exploring different climate policy options (try it
					yourself with our <a href="https://margo.plutojl.org/introduction.html">online web-app</a>).
					<!-- (run it
					right in your browser by clicking <a
						href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hdrake/ClimateWidgets/master?urlpath=pluto/open?path=MARGO_optimization_dashboard.jl">here</a>). -->
				</p>

				<p>
					I have broad interests in climatic change on long timescales (10 to 10,000 years),
					but the topics I am actively working on are:
				<ol>
					<li>tidally-generated internal waves and deep ocean mixing,</li>
					<li>submesoscale-topographic interactions,</li>
					<li>abyssal mixing layer dynamics and parameterization,</li>
					<li>meridional overturning circulation dynamics,</li>
					<li>the role of the ocean in centennial- and millenial-scale climate change,</li>
					<br>
					<li>sustainability impacts of benthic transport (e.g. deep sea mining and carbon sequestration)</li>
					<li>the predictive skill of climate models on multi-decadal and multi-centennial timescales,</li>
					<li>the role of uncertainty (and science) in climate policy.</li>
				</ol>
				If you share any of the above interests and/or would like to collaborate, please get in touch!

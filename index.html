				<h3>About me</h3>
				<p> I am a theoretical physical oceanographer who uses mathematical and computational models to understand the role of the turbulent Ocean in our changing climate. Currently, I am a NOAA Climate & Global Change Postdoctoral Fellow hosted by Dr. Sonya Legg at Princeton University and NOAA's
					Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. I received my Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography and Climate
					Physics from the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in 2021, working with Prof. Raffaele Ferrari. My doctoral dissertation demonstrates that the
					global ocean overturning circulation is controlled by the turbulent dynamics of thin bottom boundary layers in regions where the seafloor is rough. Neither the instabilities of these flows nor their interactions with small-scale topographic roughness are presently represented within global climate models. My postdoctoral work thus aims to develop parameterizations for these processes and to ultimately determine their role in the Earth System.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am generally interested in ocean and climate dynamics, especially on timescales of decades to millenia, as
					well as the history and philosophy of ocean and climate modelling. I am passionate about making
					scientific institutions more diverse and inclusive, so that all scientists feel welcome, supported,
					and valued. I also enjoy developing open-source software, such as my new package <a
						href="https://github.com/hdrake/ClimateMARGO.jl">ClimateMARGO.jl</a>, which is an extremely
					simple climate-economic model for quantitatively exploring different climate policy options (try it
					yourself with our <a href="https://margo.plutojl.org/introduction.html">online web-app</a>).
					<!-- (run it
					right in your browser by clicking <a
						href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hdrake/ClimateWidgets/master?urlpath=pluto/open?path=MARGO_optimization_dashboard.jl">here</a>). -->
				</p>

				<p>
					I have broad interests in Earth system dynamics and modelling, but the topics I am actively working on are:
				<ol>
					<li>internal waves and near-boundary mixing</li>
					<li>submesoscale-topography interactions,</li>
					<li>bottom boundary layer dynamics,</li>
					<li>meridional overturning circulation dynamics,</li>
					<li>the role of the ocean in centennial- and millenial-scale climate change,</li>
					<br>
					<li>the physics of sustainable ocean climate solutions</li>
					<li>the predictive skill of climate models on multi-decadal and multi-centennial timescales,</li>
					<li>the role of uncertainty, science, and scientists in climate policy.</li>
				</ol>
				If you share any of the above interests and/or would like to collaborate, please get in touch!

				<p> 02/28/2022 — Come drop by <a href="https://osm2022.secure-platform.com/a/gallery/rounds/3/details/1343">my talk on diapycnal motion, diffusion, and shear dispersion of tracers in the ocean</a> at the 2022 Ocean Sciences Meeting!</p>

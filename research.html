				<h3>Deep ocean tracer transport</h3>
				<p>The flows of climatically important tracers– like heat and carbon– into the deep ocean shape Earth's
					climate change trajectory; it is thus important to understand these flows deeply enough that they can be
					adequately represented in ocean models. The largest of these flows can be "resolved" by a numerical
					ocean model and emerge naturally from solving the equations of fluid mechanics on its discretized
					grid, while those that occur on scales smaller than a grid cell need to be added in separately using
					"parameterizations". Parameterization is the process of distilling the essence of a physical process
					into a simple formula or algorithm that only depends on the "resolved" environment, thus giving us a
					self-consistent way of closing the model equations without leaving out any important physics. The
					process of parameterization is complicated by the turbulent nature of oceanic flows, which links
					fluctuations at the smallest scales (a few cm) to global currents (10,000 km) and makes the ocean
					inherently chaotic and unpredictable. Developing a parameterization requires both theoretical
					understanding of the process and a training data set for calibration; in-situ observations and
					high-resolution simulations are both commonly used. While many of the most important surface mixed
					layer processes are well understood and have been successfully parameterized, the equivalent
					processes in the bottom mixed layer remain poorly understood.
					<br><br>
					In my research, I develop theoretical models of deep ocean transport processes and test these ideas
					with available data and quasi-realistic simulations. I use these theories, simulations,
					and observations to improve theoretical understanding of the global ocean circulation, develop new
					parameterizations for climate models, and inform observational campaigns (such as the
					ongoing <a

						Layer Turbulence and Abyssal Recipes</a> program).

		<!-- Dynamics of the global overturning circulation -->

			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h3>Overturning circulation theory</h3>
				<p> At the high latitudes of the Arctic and Antarctic, cold, salty, and hence dense surface waters sink
					to fill the dark abyss of the deep ocean. Since seawater mass is conserved in the ocean, we know
					that these deep waters must return to the surface elsewhere. It is convenient to split up this
					global overturning circulation into two vertically stacked (and partially connected) cells with
					different dynamics: a wind-driven adiabatic (along density surfaces) upper cell and a mixing-driven
					diabatic (across density surfaces) lower cell. In the upper cell, dense waters form in the North
					Atlantic during winter storms and flow south along density surfaces towards the Southern Ocean,
					where their upwelling by a "residual circulation" along density surfaces is the result of a
					competition between winds and turbulent eddies. These newly upwelled waters are then lightened by an
					influx of freshwater from melting sea ice, and transported back northwards to close the upper cell.
					In the lower cell, on the other hand, the bottom waters that form off the coast of Antarctica are so
					dense that they do not outcrop to the surface anywhere else in the ocean, and thus must upwell
					"diabatically", i.e. by some process that changes their density. Oceanographers originally theorized
					that these dense abyssal waters upwelled by mixing vigorously with lighter waters. This theory was
					later challenged by observations: the turbulent mixing measured in the open ocean was too weak to
					drive the required upwelling. Eventually, observations revealed that turbulence levels increased
					dramatically near the jagged hills lining the sea floor, where we now know powerful internal waves
					break and mix up the water column. These new observations seem paradoxical at first: since the
					density of seawater also increases with depth, the logical conclusion was that deep water mixes
					preferentially with <i>denser</i> waters and thus the mixing results in sinking, not upwelling! This
					paradox is resolved by considering what happens right at the bottom of the ocean, where the mixing
					runs into the seafloor and causes a thin but vigorous burst of upwelling (see schematic to the
					right).
					<br><br>
					In my research, I use geophysical theory and numerical simulations to provide insights into the
					various processes described above and the global-scale circulations that emerge when they are
					combined.

				<h3>Insights from simple climate models</h3>
				<p>My preferred scientific approach is to develop the simplest possible model that can be used to answer
					a given scientific question. The scientific problem that I am most passionate about– and which
					connects all of my research interests– is the long-term (10–10,000 year) evolution of Earth's
					climate. On these long timescales, the exchange of heat and carbon between the atmosphere and the
					ocean, and their distribution within the deep ocean, is a crucial control on Earth's climate. In the
					context of ongoing anthropogenic climate change, humans emit greenhouse gases, which weakens the
					atmosphere's ability to cool itself by radiating heat to space and causes the surface to warm. The
					atmosphere and surface of the planet responds to this warming effect (or "forcing"), causing a
					self-amplification of the warming in the net (a "positive feedback"). Thankfully, about 30% of this
					potential global warming is delayed for centuries as the ocean takes up much of the excess heat.
					These three key processes: greenhouse gas radiative forcing, radiative feedbacks, and ocean heat
					uptake, form the three key parameters in a widely used zero-dimensional "energy balance model" of
					Earth's climate. This extremely simple model can be tuned to more complicated "general circulation
					models" to yield remarkably accurate projections of global warming (see "Evaluating historical
					climate models" below) and form the basis of many climate-economic models of climate change (see my
					<i>extremely</i> simple one in the schematic on the right).
					<br><br>
					I am interested in the dynamical processes that determine the rate of ocean heat (and carbon) uptake
					in these conceptual energy balance models, how these processes might change over time, and any
					implications on long-term climate policy. I plan on continuing to develop <a
						href="https://github.com/hdrake/ClimateMARGO.jl">ClimateMARGO.jl</a>, an extremely simple
					climate-economic optimization model I created, and using it to answer fundamental questions about
					possible climate change trajectories, and how these depend on our understanding (or lack of
					understanding) of climate science.

		<!-- Evaluating Climate Models -->
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h3>Evaluating historical climate models</h3>
				<p>How accurate are numerical climate models? On what basis– if any– can we trust their projections of
					future human-caused climate change? While weather prediction enjoys the benefit of nearly-real-time
					feedback ("The weather model predicted it would be sunny today, but it's raining!"), climate
					projections of human-induced climate change takes <i>decades</i> to emerge from the chaos of natural
					variability. Unfortunately, we do not have decades to wait: we need climate action <i>now</i> to
					avoid the most catastrophic climate impacts. Climate scientists typically use indirect methods to
					build confidence in climate model projections: developing better understand of the fundamental
					climate physics processes, reducing the uncertainty in the spread across different climate models,
					and improving the how well models reproduce historical observations.
					<br><br>
					Over the last few years, my collaborators and I have been taking a different approach: while we
					cannot just wait decades to find out whether <i>today's</i> climate projections come true, we can
					dig up decades-old projections and see how well they held up. (Spoiler: they did pretty well, as
					shown in the figure on the right). By combing the old IPCC archives and digitizing figures from
					historical papers, my collaborators and I have reconstructed a unique dataset of nearly every single
					climate model projection ever made. The dataset is rich and I am excited the about all of the
					otherwise unanswerable questions that it allows us to answer!

			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h3>Wind-driven overturning circulation</h3>
				<p> The mixing-driven upwelling described above can only upwell abyssal waters up to depths of about 2000m, above which wind-driven processes return deep waters to the surface. Easterly winds reach their maximum intensity in the land-free latitudes of the Southern Ocean, driving Ekman upwelling and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The winds pull deep waters to the surface along sloping surfaces of constant density (isopycnals). These sloping isopycnals (and the associated ACC) are generally unstable and spawn vigorous mesoscale eddies, act to slow the upwelling until the two strike a balance. Due to the treacherous conditions of the Southern Ocean and the difficulty of modelling mesoscale eddies, much of our current understanding of the wind-driven Southern Ocean overturning circulation comes from idealized models and theory. I use both high-resolution climate models and observations to further our understanding of the wind-driven overturning circulation.

				<h3> Lagrangian analysis of geophysical flows</h3>
				<p> While geophysical flows are typically viewed from a fixed frame of reference (Eulerian perspective), it is often desirable to view geophysical flows from a frame of reference that follows the flow (Lagrangian perspective). The Lagrangian approach is particularly useful for determining how water (or anything carried by water) flows from one region to another or is transformed over time. Lagrangian analysis can be applied either to inherently Lagrangian observations (i.e. surface drifters or Argo floats) or to velocity field output from Ocean General Circulation Models by integrating in time. Applications of Lagrangian analysis include tracking of nutrients, larvae, microplastics, icebergs, oil droplets, etc. As a physical oceanographer, I am particularly interested in using Lagrangian analysis to track how seawater and tracers such as heat and salinity are moved around by ocean currents.
